# Professional Portfolio

## Description

The purpose of this challenge is to create a portfolio for my professional work. Through this portforlio, prospective employers are able look through my previous work and see if my objectives align with theirs. If our objectives do align, there is a contact me section where employers can find to contact me. One thing I learned from this assignment is that making that website responsive is quite challenging.
